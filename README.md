# Factory Hazard Mitigation model

The Worker-Machine Distance Monitoring System is a project developed to enhance safety in factory environments by accurately detecting and monitoring the distance between workers and machines. This system utilizes YOLO V8, an advanced object detection algorithm, and ultrasonic sensors for precise distance measurements.

## Features

- Accurate distance detection using YOLO V8 and ultrasonic sensors.
- Creation of designated safety zones to define safe distances.
- Alert mechanism: Sirens are activated as a warning when a worker enters the inner zone.
- Automatic machine shutdown: If a worker gets too close, the machine is automatically shut down.
- Redundancy: Measurements obtained using two methods for improved accuracy.
- Scalability: Easily configurable and extendable for additional machines and zones.
