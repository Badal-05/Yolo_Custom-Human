Developed a worker-machine distance monitoring system for factory environments.
Utilized YOLO V8, an advanced object detection algorithm, for accurate object recognition.
Integrated ultrasonic sensors to measure the distance between workers and machines.
Implemented designated zones to define safe distances.
Activated sirens as an initial warning when a worker approaches the inner zone.
Implemented an automatic machine shutdown mechanism when a worker gets too close.
Enhanced safety in the workplace by providing redundant and accurate distance measurements using two methods.
